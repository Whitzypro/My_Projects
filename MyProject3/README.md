JS Clock

This project is a simple, but functional and beautiful clock It was a boring afternoon so I went online to search for projects to build and I stumbled on this one

The clock displays the time and has a 12 and 24 hours button with which you can easily swutch to the one you prefer.

The days of the week are also displayed above and the right day is highlighted.

As at the time of this commit, I haven't media-queried the app to display well on mobile devices; so feel free to contribute that. Or, you might be late and I have added it already.
