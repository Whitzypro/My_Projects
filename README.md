Hello üòç
Welcome to `My_Projects` repository

In this repo, I have taken time to document in details the projects I have built on my journey as a web developer.

You get to see simple stuffs I did after getting the hang on html, css and bootstrap. You will thereafter slide into more complex and interesting stuffs I built after grasping Javascript, React, API calls, Node, etc.

Some of the projects you will see in this repo are: i). Redesign of DuckDuckGo front page. I also added a dark mode button. ii). A Javascript clock. It has a 12 and 24 hour format and a buttons to switch to the format you want. All the days of the week are also displayed and the correct day is always highlighted. iii). A birthday reminder app. A simple but beautiful react app that shows birthdays for the day. iv). A Tour app. A react app that displays available tours. Customers can choose from the avialble tours or delete the once they are not interested in to make decison making easier. v). A Paragraph generator. A react app that lets you generate meaningful paragraphs on the fly.

Feel free to contribute to any of the projects.

I will update my readme as more projects come in.

I hope you enjoy it here
