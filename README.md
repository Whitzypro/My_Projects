Hello üòç
Welcome to `My_Projects` repository

In this repo, I have taken time to document in details the projects I have built on my journey as a web developer

You get to see simple stuffs I did after getting the hang on html, css and bootstrap. You will thereafter slide into more complex and interesting stuffs I built after grasping Javascript, React, API calls and Node

Some of the projects you will see in this repo are: i). Front page of a school website with a login page and a registeration form: this was my very first project. ii). Redesign or DuckDuck front page. I also added a dark mode button. iii). A Javascript clock. This a little bit of more functoionality than what the assignment stated (lol...I did my home work very well). It has a 12 and 24 hour format and a buttons to switch to the format you want. All the days of the week are also displayed and the correct day is always highlighted.

Feel free to contribute to any of the projects.

I will update my readme as more projects come in.

I hope you enjoy it here
