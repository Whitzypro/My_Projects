TOURS

This is a Tours app I made with react
It's actually from a tutorial but I added more functionality

I made this app just few days into learning react. I had only learnt the useState hook.
So the app is basically html, css and useState.

You get to browse through available tours and see the ones you like and there prices.

You can also remove the ones you are not interested in.

And if you mistakenly removed the ones you like or you removed a tour but later changed your mind, there is a restore button to bring it all back

Feel free to contribute.

# I deployed the app on netlify; so feel free to check
