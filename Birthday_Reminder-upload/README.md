I built this app just as i started getting the hang on React. 
i basically made use of only useState

The app has a list of birthdays for the day.
You have a button that allows you remove a birthday that is passed and it is reflected in the birthday count in the header.
You can also delete all birthdays and if you deleted all by mistake, you can restore with the bold and beautiful restore button

I am so in love with the UI of this app.

At the point I built this app, I didn't implement any API calls so the data is entirely static.

This might have changed by the time you are visiting
