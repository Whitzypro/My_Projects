My friend who is focused on the backend hit me up and asked me to help him with this design.
He dropped me the picture on Telegram and honestly, at the first site, it was a bit intimidating

The design has a lot of little details

Of course I told him I could do it in a day or two.

At the end, I produced a page that almost exactly matches the design in less than 48hrs.

This project has just raw html and css

_this project is built to be viewed on only large screens (PCs)._
