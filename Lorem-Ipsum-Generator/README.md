Paragraph Generator

A small react app that lets you generate as much paragraphs as possible on the fly.

It can be very useful when you are working on a project and you need dummy texts to fill space or for some other reasons, you need placeholder paragraphs.

Unlike the traditional lorem ipsum, this paragraph generator generates real sentences that make sense.

It's actually a small app and i made use of only then useState hook and one component was enough to do the job.

Check out the deployed app at: 
# react-paragraph-generator.netlify.app

Contributions are very much welcome to this project.

Enjoy!
