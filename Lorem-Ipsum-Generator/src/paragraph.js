    {id: 1,text:"Research ethics are the set of ethics that govern how scientific and other research is performed at research institutions such as universities, and how it is disseminated. When most people think of research ethics, they think about issues that arise when research involves human or animal subjects. While these issues are indeed a key part of research ethics, there are also wider issues about standards of conduct. These include the importance of publishing findings in a transparent way, not plagiarizing others work, and not falsifying work."},
    {id: 2, text: "This means that you need to report your research honestly, and that this applies to your methods (what you did), your data, your results, and whether you have previously published any of it. You should not make up any data, including extrapolating unreasonably from some of your results, or do anything which could be construed as trying to mislead anyone. It is better to undersell than over-exaggerate your findings."},
    {id: 3, text: "You should aim to avoid bias in any aspect of your research, including design, data analysis, interpretation, and peer review. For example, you should never recommend as a peer reviewer someone you know, or who you have worked with, and you should try to ensure that no groups are inadvertently excluded from your research. This also means that you need to disclose any personal or financial interests that may affect your research."},
    {id: 4, text: "You should never plagiarize, or copy, other people’s work and try to pass it off as your own. You should always ask for permission before using other people’s tools or methods, unpublished data or results. Not doing so is plagiarism. Obviously, you need to respect copyrights and patents, together with other forms of intellectual property, and always acknowledge contributions to your research. If in doubt, acknowledge, to avoid any risk of plagiarism."},
    {id: 5, text: "If your research involves people, you should make sure that you reduce any possible harm to the minimum, and maximize the benefits both to participants and other people. This means, for example, that you should not expose people to more tests than are strictly necessary to fulfil your research aims. You should always respect human rights, including the right to privacy and autonomy. You may need to take particular care with vulnerable groups, "},
    {id: 6, text: "Most universities have an ethics committee. This is required to scrutinize all research proposals, to ensure that they do not raise any ethical issues. This will generally include research for master’s and undergraduate degrees, although undergraduate research may be covered by a broader research proposal from your supervisor."},
    {id: 7, text: "For example, if you are proposing to carry out a study on a particular disease, and you want to ask all your participants whether they are married and have any children, the committee may want to know why this is relevant. It may be relevant (for example, if you think the disease may be reduced by living in a family), in which case, you will need to justify this."},
    {id: 8, text: "The ethical assessments related to the use of animals in research are wide-ranging. It is generally thought that it may be necessary to use laboratory animals in some cases in order to create improvements for people, animals or the environment. At the same time, the general opinion is that animals have a moral status, and that our treatment of them should be subject to ethical considerations. Such views are reflected in the following positions:"},
    {id: 9, text: "The guidelines reflect all these positions, and stipulate principles and considerations that can be used as tools when balancing between harm and benefit. The three Rs (Replace, Reduce, Refine) are established principles that are also enshrined in legislation. These principles can establish absolute limits for experiments on animals, even when there are great benefits. These principles also state what can reasonably be considered harm and benefit, and the principles thus facilitate good assessments. Assessments of harm and benefit associated with experiments on animals are particularly demanding, because experiments may result in researchers intentionally causing actual harm to animals, while the future benefits are often uncertain."},
    {id: 10, text: "Researchers must consider the risk that laboratory animals experience pain and other suffering (see guideline 5) and assess them in relation to the value of the research for animals, people or the environment. Researchers are responsible for considering whether the experiment may result in improvements for animals, people or the environment. The possible benefits of the study must be considered, substantiated and specified in both the short and the long term. The responsibility also entails an obligation to consider the scientific quality of the experiments and whether the experiments will have relevant scientific benefits. "},
    {id: 11, text: "Researchers are responsible for assessing the expected effect on laboratory animals. Researchers must minimize the risk of suffering and provide good animal welfare. Suffering includes pain, hunger, thirst, malnutrition, abnormal cold or heat, fear, stress, injury, illness and restrictions on the ability to behave normally/naturally. "},
    {id: 12, text: "Researchers must not only consider the direct suffering that may be endured during the experiment itself, but also the risk of suffering before and after the experiment, including trapping, labelling, anaesthetizing, breeding, transportation, stabling and euthanizing. This means that researchers must also take account of the need for periods of adaptation before and after the experiment."},
    {id: 13, text: "Researchers are responsible for ensuring that the use of laboratory animals does not endanger biological diversity. This means that researchers must consider the consequences to the stock and to the ecosystem as a whole. The use of endangered and vulnerable species must be reduced to an absolute minimum. When there is credible, but uncertain, knowledge that the inclusion of animals in research or the use of certain methods may have ethically unacceptable consequences for the stock and the ecosystem as a whole, researchers must observe the precautionary principle."},
    {id: 14, text: "Researchers are responsible for reducing disruption and any impact on the natural behaviour of individual animals, including those that are not direct subjects of research, as well as of populations and their surroundings. Certain research and technology-related projects, like those regarding environmental technology and environmental surveillance, may impact on animals and their living conditions, for example as a result of installing radar masts, antennas or other measurement instruments. In such cases, researchers must seek to observe the principle of proportionality (see guideline 3) and minimize the possible negative impact."},
    {id: 15, text: "Researchers are responsible for ensuring that there is transparency about research findings and facilitating the sharing of data and material from experiments on animals. Such transparency and sharing are important in order to avoid unnecessary repetition of experiments. Transparency is also important in order to ensure that the public are informed and is part of researchers' responsibility for dissemination. "},
    {id: 16, text: "In general, the negative results of experiments on animals should be public knowledge. Disclosing negative results may give other researchers information about which experiments are not worth pursuing, shine a light on unfortunate research design, and help reduce the use of animals in research."},
    {id: 17, text: "Researchers and other parties who handle live animals must have adequately updated and documented expertise on animals. This includes specific knowledge about the biology of the animal species in question, and a willingness and ability to take care of animals properly. "},
    {id: 18, text: "There are national laws and rules and international conventions and agreements regarding the use of laboratory animals, and both researchers and research managers must comply with these. Any person who plans to use animals in experiments must familiarize themselves with the current rules."},
    {id: 19, text: "Aside from the opportunities of multiple figures, perspectives, and mental shift this program avail to you, those who stay to this end of this course will be given a lifetime opportunity to enter a wealth-oriented network, which opens you up to numerous opportunities whose goal is to create young retirees in the long run. "},
    {id: 20, text: "You will understand why people get rich but never become wealthy. These teachings will expose you to the simple but powerful laws you must follow to create unending wealth."}
